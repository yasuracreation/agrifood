# TRANSFORMING AGRI-FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS IN SRI LANKA: A BLOCKCHAIN-
BASED APPROACH

## Introduction

Sri Lanka's agri-food supply chain is vital to the country's economic welfare, supporting numerous
communities. However, it faces significant challenges such as information asymmetry, trust issues, and
quality control, resulting in inefficiencies that affect both producers and consumers. The primary
objective of this research is to create, implement, and evaluate a blockchain-based solution tailored to
the unique needs of Sri Lanka's agri-food supply chain.
Existing literature highlights the importance of transparency, accountability, and efficiency in modern
supply chains. Studies have shown that blockchain technology can enhance trust among stakeholders,
ensure quality assurance through rigorous validation procedures, and improve transparency and
traceability using smart contracts and cryptographic algorithms.
This research framework integrates blockchain technology with machine learning to design a multi-
layered system. The Application Layer facilitates stakeholder interactions, the Validation Layer
ensures data accuracy through both human and machine learning checks, and the Blockchain Layer
secures data storage. The development leverages Ethereum and Truffle for blockchain, PyTorch for
machine learning, Node.js for the backend, Cassandra for data caching, and Docker for deployment.
The main results of this work demonstrate that the proposed blockchain solution significantly
enhances transparency, accuracy, and scalability. It optimizes resource utilization, reduces information
asymmetry, and transforms the agri-food sector into a more resilient and transparent system. By
addressing these challenges, this research contributes to the sustainable development of Sri Lanka's
agri-food supply chain.
